## Overview

> Half formed ideas.  
> Poorly written blog posts. 

> > A writing style that can't decide whether it's whismical, serious or cosplaying a character from a Lovecraft novel.  

> A quiet space for practicing my own writing.  

> Abandoned thoughts.  

## Blog Posts

The scintilla in your brain reach their activation threshold at the prospect of consuming the unforseen content.

Your quest ends in fathomless disappointment.

There is no content here.

## Half-Formed Ideas

They're like blog posts, but lacking any kind of direction or coherency.  
A dumping ground for ideas that I think are _cool_ and want to write them down so I don't lose them.
> _Information Hazard_  
> Some of these might be boring or just dumb. You were warned.

The sharp corners of your reality shifts.

You find yourself where you were found.
