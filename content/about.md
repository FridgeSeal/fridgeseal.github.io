# About Me

My name is Tom, I am based in Sydney and I currently work as a Data-Scientist // Dev // Data-Engineer // team Dev Ops person for a legal-tech company. As is seemingly the curse of a 'data-scientist' my actual day-to-day work covers a large superset of my core skill-set: I do most of the dev-ops work for our team, including provisioning and maintaining our Kubernetes cluster (via EKS + Terraform), writing and maintaining some of our data-engineering pipelines (some in Spark, some PoC ones in Rust), writing and maintaining the Rust-based GRPC API's other teams use to interface with our teams data + services, and rarely, some actual data science.

At the moment, I'm learning/writing mostly in Rust.

# Personal Stuff

Broadly, my i nterests and hobbies include skiing (the snow kind), mountain/road biking, bouldering, electronic music, science fiction, mathematics and left wing politics + economics.
More broadly, when it comes to technical topics, I am interested in efficient, high-performance, elegant and correct systems (distributed + not). When it comes to _personal projects_ I am biased towards engineering quality over speed-of-developement (the latter being a much overhyped concept in the first place) and approaches that explore interesting + underappreciated areas of maths/computer science and push the boundaries of what is possible and interesting. Backwards compatibility has it's place, but it's widely overrated and I'm fascinated by specialised and interesting software design/architecture/application/etc even if it's a dead-end, or not generally applicable.
I think that as an indsutry/collective, the software and hardware we build should strive to be ethical, inclusive, environmentally-sustainable and embody humane/human-centered design. A good description is found here:

> Design applied in technology (UIs, apps, software in general) that follow specific principles aligned to human being’s needs, self-determination and freedom. Humane design empowers people to do what they want to do in their life, their objectives and desires. Humane design doesn’t exploit people’s weaknesses, biases and neuroscience knowledge to distract them. User attention to a humanely designed UI, app, software lasts as long as it is deserved. Humane designers must always ask themselves: how much will this help the users in their lives?

This is a blog/space where I will post thoughts - incomplete and otherwise. It's mostly a space to document ideas and jot them down while I think develop them. A lot of the content will be "evergreen" as I come back to it over the course of its lifetime.

In case it really needs to be said:
#### All thoughts, opinions and ideas are _my own_ and not those of my employer etc etc etc.


### What's in a name
Why the name `FridgeSeal`?  
It's a pun! :grinning:  
- Fridges are cold places
- Seals live in cold places
- Fridges have seals in them
